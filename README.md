# Capstone Project improving a bikeshare company
My Google Analytics final project.

## Project Overview
As part of my google analytics certification i was required to complete a capstone project. I decided to do it on a bikeshare company with the aim of increasing the conversion rate from non-subscriber users to subscribers.

I utilised many of the skills i learnt on the course aswell as several others to create a detailed R-markdown document and mock-report, in it i include:
* Compelling data vizuilzations made using R, which include:
  *  Static maps overlayed with data using ggmaps
  *  Density plots
  *  Violin graphs
  *  A variety of visually apealing bar charts
* the entireity of my code used in both R and SQL
